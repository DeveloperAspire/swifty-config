# Getting Started with ⚡️ Swifty Config

This project was bootstrapped with 🛠️ [⚡️ Swift Config](https://github.com/DeveloperAspire/swifty-config).

## Commands to execute.

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

### `yarn dev`

Runs the app in the development mode 🚀.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when changes are made to any file in the application.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles the application in production mode, and optimizes the build for the best performance 📦.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## What more can you do?

If you love this project and the setup, it will be okay to give this project a star on [Github](https://github.com/DeveloperAspire/swifty-config). and share with friends as this will help make the project more avaliable and popular and yeah, helps boost my little ego 🧑‍💻

## What more can you expect?

More frameworks and templates will be added and also more configurations and also I will be improving this to be more world classish.
