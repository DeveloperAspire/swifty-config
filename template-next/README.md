# template-next

This is the Next.js template of the Swifty Config.

There two variations, the JavaScript variant &mdash; which gets listed as `next`, when you run the swifty-config command &mdash; and the TypeScript variant, which is listed as `next-ts`

## Usage

To use this template, follow the instructions in the terminal when you type any of the commands below

```bash
npx create-swifty-config

npm create-swifty-config

yarn create swifty-config

```

Proceed by selecting your preferred variant. For extra spices, you can decide to add a Next.js config file, `next-config.js`, to customize the template as you wish.

And as usual, start by editing `pages/index.js` to see the changes
