This is a Frontend game built with JavaScript, the game play is actually based on tyring to keep the Fox alive (Object of the game) by feeding, and caring for it as humans would do to a pet.

This project was for practice while I was learning how to build intentionally using techniques that will help me build well like choosing the right Frontend Infastructures, Frontend Architecture, because I was able to try and bring out the best code possible

## To run this locally

Run `yarn dev`

Unfortunately there is no live version.

## How to advanced this?
* Unit tests.
* Splitting the Code and Styles into more files.
* Make it more accessible.
* Add a State Machine that manages states.
* Use TypeScript for Type Safety.
* Replicate using any Frontend Framework.
* Replicate using a Backend Framework.
* Using LocalStorage to Store state for a users when they pause e.t.c.
