# ‚ö°Ô∏è Swifty Config

> With one command, setup your Frontend project with additional configuration out of the box.

# What does this do?

See this as create-react-app with extra, I know you are tired from having to setup prettier, Eslint e.t.c all the time, or you are tired of doing the same thing all over and over again, I created this to help, personally as a side project to help myself, but then you might need it.

> **Compatibility Note:**
> ‚ö°Ô∏è Swifty Config requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) version >=14.6.0. Some other in this project may request higher Node.js version to work, follow the insturctions to upgrade your package manager when you see the error or warning about it.

## Using ‚ö°Ô∏è Swifty Config for the first time.

With NPX:

```bash
$ npx create-swifty-config
```

With NPM:

```bash
$ npm create swifty-config
```

With Yarn:

```bash
$ yarn create swifty-config
```

Then follow the prompts to setup the project!

## Currently avaliable template include:

- `vanilla`
- `vanilla-ts`
- `react`
- `react-ts`
- `next`

This will be updated with more templates.

You can use `.` for the project name to scaffold in the current directory.

## What more can you do?

If you love this project and the setup, it will be okay to give this project a star on [Github](https://github.com/DeveloperAspire/swifty-config). and share with friends as this will help make the project more avaliable and popular and yeah, helps boost my little ego üßë‚Äçüíª

## What more can you expect?

More frameworks and templates will be added and also more configurations and also I will be improving this to be more world classish.

## Contributions??

Coming soon!!! Cause I need your help to make it better!.
